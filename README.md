## Overview

AAIE is a modular, automated framework for adversarial robustness testing of machine learning-based security classifiers. It implements a surrogate-based black-box transfer attack pipeline: adversarial examples are crafted against a differentiable surrogate model and transferred to an opaque target classifier, emulating realistic threat scenarios where the attacker has no direct access to the production system.

The core finding this implementation validates: **single-step FGSM achieves higher cross-architecture transferability than iterative PGD** when attacking a Random Forest target via a neural network surrogate — a counterintuitive result with direct implications for scalable adversarial stress-testing of deployed ML detectors.

## Models

### Target Model — Random Forest Classifier
Emulates production-grade ML malware detectors commonly deployed in endpoint security products.

| Hyperparameter | Value |
|----------------|-------|
| n_estimators | 200 |
| max_depth | 15 |
| class_weight | balanced |
| random_state | 42 |

### Surrogate Model — Neural Network
Trained via pseudo-labeling (target RF predictions as labels) to approximate the target's decision boundary without direct access to its parameters.

| Component | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| Architecture | Fully-connected: 30 → 64 → 32 → 2 |
| Activations | ReLU (hidden), Softmax (output) |
| Loss | Cross-entropy |
| Optimizer | Adam (lr=1e-3, weight_decay=1e-4) |
| Training | Full-batch, deterministic |

---

## Adversarial Attacks

Both attacks are applied in feature space on the surrogate, then transferred to the target RF.

### FGSM (Fast Gradient Sign Method)
Single-step attack (Goodfellow et al., ICLR 2015):

$$\delta = \varepsilon \cdot \text{sign}(\nabla_x \mathcal{L}(f_\theta(x), y))$$

### PGD (Projected Gradient Descent)
Iterative attack (Madry et al., ICLR 2018), 10 steps, step size α = ε/4:

$$x^{(t+1)} = \text{Proj}_{x+\mathcal{S}}\left(x^{(t)} + \alpha \cdot \text{sign}(\nabla_x \mathcal{L}(f_\theta(x^{(t)}), y))\right)$$

**Perturbation budgets evaluated:**
`ε ∈ {0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.05, 0.075, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20}` (L∞ norm)

---

## Evaluation Metrics

| Metric | Symbol | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Attack Success Rate | ASR | Fraction of adversarial examples that cause misclassification |
| Transferability Score | TS = ASR_target / ASR_surrogate | Cross-model attack effectiveness; TS > 1 means target is more vulnerable than surrogate |
| Detection Evasion Ratio | DER = 100 × (DR_adv − DR_clean) | Stealth against secondary OC-SVM anomaly detector; negative = better evasion |
| Resilience Index | RI ∈ [0,100] | Composite metric: 0.4 × accuracy preservation + 0.4 × attack resistance + 0.2 × stealth |

---

## Results

### Key Finding

> **FGSM (single-step) achieves higher transferability than PGD (iterative) when attacking a Random Forest via a neural network surrogate.**

This is statistically significant: paired t-test t = 5.234, **p = 0.00112**, Cohen's d = 0.742.

### Attack Success Rate

| ε | FGSM ASR | PGD ASR | FGSM Advantage |
|---|----------|---------|----------------|
| 0.050 | 0.321 | 0.278 | +13.5% |
| 0.100 | 0.454 | 0.362 | +20.3% |
| **0.150** | **0.529** | **0.437** | **+17.4%** |
| 0.200 | 0.527 | 0.452 | +14.3% |

### Transferability Score

FGSM achieves **TS = 0.802** at ε = 0.15, with **19.4% higher average TS** than PGD across all budgets.

### Resilience Index at ε = 0.15

| Condition | RI |
|-----------|-----|
| Clean (no attack) | 100.0 |
| Under FGSM | 54.99 |
| Under PGD | 49.76 |

Both fall in the **moderate resilience** range (33–66), indicating that current ML malware detectors remain meaningfully vulnerable to transfer attacks.

### Why Does FGSM Transfer Better?

PGD iteratively ascends the surrogate's loss landscape, overfitting to the neural network's local curvature and non-linear decision boundary geometry. When transferred to a Random Forest — whose tree-based partitioning creates fundamentally different decision boundaries — these overfit perturbations fail.

FGSM's single gradient step produces a coarser perturbation that aligns with generalizable vulnerability directions shared across model families, consistent with recent theoretical work on feature-level transferability (Li et al., 2025; Zheng et al., 2025).

# Cybersecurity datasets

Attackers demonstrate the performance of their adversarial attacks based on different datasets and victim models. This brings obstacles to objectively evaluating the adversarial attacks and measuring the robustness of deep learning models. In particular, large and high-quality datasets usually make it hard for adversaries/defenders to attack/defend. In this subsection, we provide an overview of the most prominent datasets employed in building DL-based defense systems and using adversarial machine learning approaches in the cybersecurity domain, organized per specific application/category. Herein, we can find a curated list of cybersecurity datasets.

## Network Intrusion Detection
* [KDD Cup 1999:](https://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html) was created based on the DARPA 1998 dataset and inherit the same problems. Nevertheless, it is one of the most employed datasets until now for network intrusion detection. KDDCup99 includes full-packet data, break into subsets for training and testing. The network traffic is labeled in five classes: Normal, Probe, User to Root attacks, Remote to Local attacks, and DoS attacks. 
* [NSL-KDD:](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/nsl.html) is an improved version of KDD Cup 1999 built to alleviate the redundancy problems, another often used dataset for network intrusion detection. However, it should be regarded that the underlying network traffic of NSL-KDD dates back to the year 1998. The dataset is labeled following the same structure as KDDCup99 and comprises separate sets for training and testing. 
* [CTU-13:](https://www.stratosphereips.org/datasets-ctu13) is a dataset of botnet traffic captured in the CTU University, Czech Republic, in 2011. The dataset aimed to have a large capture of real botnet traffic mixed with normal and background traffic. The CTU-13 dataset includes thirteen captures (i.e., scenarios) of different botnet samples. In each scenario, we executed a specific malware, which employed several protocols and performed different actions. 
* [AWID:](https://icsdweb.aegean.gr/awid/) focuses on 802.11 networks. A small network environment with ten clients was designed to capture WLAN traffic in a packet-based format. In one hour, around 2 million packets were captured. 155 features were extracted from each packet. For generating malicious traffic, 15 specific attacks against the 802.11 network (e.g., Probe Request, and CTS Flooding) were executed. The dataset is labeled and divided into a training and a test subset.
* [CIC-IDS2017:](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html) consists of labeled network flows, including full packet payloads in PCAP format, the corresponding profiles and the labeled flows and CSV files.
* [CSE-CIC-IDS2018:](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2018.html) includes seven different attack scenarios, namely Brute-force, Heartbleed, Botnet, DoS, DDoS, Web attacks, and infiltration of the network from inside. The attacking infrastructure includes 50 machines, and the victim organization has five departments includes 420 PCs and 30 servers. This dataset includes each machine's network traffic and logs files from the victim side, along with 80 network traffic features extracted from captured traffic using CICFlowMeter-V3.
* [CIC-DDoS2019:](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ddos-2019.html) contains many different DDoS attacks that can be carried out through application layer protocols using TCP/UDP. The taxonomy of attacks in the dataset is performed in terms of exploitation-based and reflection-based attacks. The dataset was collected in two separate days for training and testing evaluation. The training set was captured on January 12th, 2019, and contains 12 different kinds of DDoS attacks, each attack type in a separated PCAP file. The attack types in the training day include UDP, SNMP, NetBIOS, LDAP, TFTP, NTP, SYN, WebDDoS, MSSQL, UDP-Lag, DNS, and SSDP DDoS based attacks. The testing data was created on March 11th, 2019, and contains 7 DDoS attacks SYN, MSSQL, UDP-Lag, LDAP, UDP, PortScan, and NetBIOS.
* [LITNET-2020:](https://dataset.litnet.lt/) comprises real network attacks in Lithuanian-wide network with servers in four geographic locations within the country. The breakdown of the traffic types is: Smurf (0.13%), ICMP-Flood (0.03%), UDP-Flood (0.21%), TCP SYN-flood (8.22%), HTTP flood (0.05%), LAND Attack (0.12%), Blaster Worm (0.05%), Code Red Worm (2.77%), Spam Bot Detection (0.002%), Reaper Worm (0.003%), Scanning/Spread (0.01%), Packet Fragmentation Attack (0.001%), Normal (88.24%). The entropy across attack classes is lower at 0.333 than between normal and anomalous traffic at 0.522.
* [TON_IoT:](https://research.unsw.edu.au/projects/toniot-datasets) involves heterogeneous data sources collected from Telemetry datasets of IoT and IIoT sensors, operating systems datasets of Windows 7 and 10 as well as Ubuntu 14 and 18 TLS and Network traffic datasets. The datasets were collected from a realistic and large-scale network designed at the Cyber Range and IoT Labs, the School of Engineering and Information technology (SEIT), UNSW Canberra the Australian Defence Force Academy. A new testbed network was built for the industry 4.0 network, including the Internet of Things (IoT) and Industrial (IIoT) networks. The testbed was deployed employing multiple virtual machines and hosts of windows, Linux, and Kali operating systems to manage the interconnection between the three layers of IoT, Cloud, and Edge/Fog systems. Various attacking techniques, such as DoS, DDoS, and ransomware, against web applications, IoT gateways, and computer systems across the IoT/IIoT network. The datasets were gathered in parallel processing to collect several normal and cyber-attack events from network traffic, Windows audit traces, Linux audit traces, and telemetry data of IoT services.
* [IoT-23:](https://www.stratosphereips.org/datasets-iot23) consists of twenty-three captures (called scenarios) of different IoT network traffic. These scenarios are divided into twenty network captures (PCAP files) from infected IoT devices (which will have the name of the malware sample executed on each scenario), and three network captures of real IoT devices network traffic (that have the name of the devices where the traffic was captured). A specific malware sample in a Raspberry Pi that used several protocols and performed different actions was executed on each malicious scenario.

* [BATADAL:](https://www.batadal.net/data.html) represents a water distribution network comprised of seven storage tanks with eleven pumps and five valves, controlled via nine Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs). The network was created using epanetCPA, an open-source, object-oriented Matlab toolbox that allows for the injections of cyber-physical attacks and simulates the response of the network to these attacks. The dataset contains 43 variables, representing the tank water levels (7 variables), the flow and status of all the pumps (24 variables), as well as the inlet and pressure for the pumping stations and valves (12 variables). All variables are continuous, except the status of valve and pumps, represented by binary variables. The training data simulates hourly measurements collected for 356 days, resulting in 8.761 records. The test set comprises 2.089 records, which were gathered for 90 days. There exist seven attacks present in the test data. The attacks involved malicious actuator activation, sensor measurement manipulation, and PLC setpoint changes. Besides, the attacks were concealed from the SCADA system by replacing the PLC-to-SCADA communication data with the data recorded at the same hour during normal operation. BATADAL can be download freely on the website.

## Encrypted traffic analysis
* [ISCX VPN-nonVPN:](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/vpn.html) was collected at University of New Brunswick and it contains raw pcap files of several traffic types. The dataset provides fine-grained labels which allows different categorization: application-based (e.g. AIM chat, Gmail, Facebook, etc), traffic-type-based (e.g. chat, streaming, VoIP, etc), and VPN/non-VPN. 
* [ISCX Tor-nonTor:](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/tor.html) was created available by the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity. Three users were used for browser traffic collection and two users for communication (mail, FTP, etc.). There are eight different categories for TOR traffic: Browsing, audio, video, chat, mail, VoIP, FTP, and P2P.
* [Open HTTPS:](http://betternet.lhs.loria.fr/datasets/https/index.html) was constructed by crawling HTTPS websites over two weeks (September 2016). It contains full HTTPS raw PCAP files of crawling top 779 accessed HTTPS websites. The scan was made daily based, two times per day using Goolge Chrome and Mozilla Firefox Web browsers.
* [QUIC:](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Pvev0hJ82usPh6dWDlz7Lv8L6h3JpWhE) was captured at the University of California at Davis, which contains QUIC traffic of 5 Google services: Google Doc (1251 flows), Google Drive (1664 flows), Google Music (622 flows), Youtube (1107 flows), Google Search (1945 flows). The dataset contains time-series features: packet length, relative time, and direction. The dataset has already been pre-processed. 

## Fraud detection
* [German Credit Data:](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/german-credit) classifies people into good or bad credit risks.
